so till now we made 2-3 currency converter apps 
In the first we had to enter any one of the currency amounts in the textfield and then by clicking the button we get the converted amounts but in this approach we need to write the converstion code in  a function
in the next app we added a method called addEventListener and whenever we changed the textfield the another text field is instantly updated
in the third app we made it similar to first approach but we fetch the live currency rates from the api 

So now our motive is to integrate all the lernings from about and build a app that takes the amount and instantly updates the rates using api and further may add some more currencies in future.
